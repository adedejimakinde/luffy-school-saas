"""Moving a result sheet along the chain. The only supported way to write one.

Five acts: submit, check, approve, release, and send back. Each is its own
function because each is a different decision by a different person, and a
single `transition(to=...)` would have made the authority table a lookup that
every caller could get wrong.

Every one of them does the same four things in the same order, and the order is
the security-relevant part:

1. **Check who is asking**, at the school on the connection — *before* anything
   is read or locked. `gradebook.api`'s `ExistenceOracleTests` settled this for
   the codebase: a caller who may not act should not be able to tell a sheet
   that exists from one that does not by which refusal comes back. It also
   keeps somebody with no authority from holding a row lock at all.
2. **Take the row lock.** `select_for_update()` on the sheet. Two people
   pressing approve at the same instant would otherwise both read `checked`,
   both find the move legal, and both write.

   What the lock buys was measured rather than assumed, and it is narrower than
   it sounds: `one_transition_to_each_state_per_cycle` already refuses the
   second row, so an unlocked race does **not** corrupt the audit. The lock is
   what makes the loser receive a `WrongState` naming where the sheet got to,
   instead of an unhandled `IntegrityError` — a 500 on a principal's screen
   saying nothing. See `tests/test_approval_concurrency.py` for the control run.
3. **Check the state under that lock**, never the state on the instance the
   caller passed in — that one was read at some earlier moment and can have
   moved since.
4. **Check they have not already signed this pass** — the same-signatory rule,
   also under the lock.

Then the row is written and the sheet is updated inside one transaction, so a
sheet whose state says `approved` always has a row saying who approved it.

`open_sheet()` is the sixth function and the only one that is not a signature.
It still takes an actor and still checks authority first, and the reason is the
paragraph below rather than anything about opening a sheet: a claim that a
module has no actor-less primitives is falsified by one, and it was exported.

The `_as()` split the other service modules use is deliberately *absent* here.
There are no primitives: every act in this module is somebody's signature, so
there is no version of it that makes sense without an actor. A data migration
that wants to move a sheet has to name the person it is moving it on behalf of,
which is the right amount of friction for rewriting an approval chain.

Authority is always asked at the school **on the connection**, and the portal is
refused rather than treated as a school — see `_school_on_this_connection()`,
which is where that used to raise `School.DoesNotExist` out of the module's own
exception hierarchy.

# these sets as narrow as possible.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: A class teacher submits. An administrator is here because entering and
#: submitting a paper sheet is office work in most schools — the same reasoning
#: `gradebook.MARK_ENTERING_ROLES` gives for admitting one.

#: This was `{principal, admin}`, on the argument that release is commonly gated
#: on something clerical — fees settled, cards printed — rather than being a
#: second academic judgement. That argument is not wrong about schools, but it
#: contradicted a decision already taken for this phase, and the contradiction
#: was load-bearing rather than cosmetic: **task 8 makes revision principal-only
#: on the stated grounds that "release is the principal's act, so revision is
#: too."** Widening release here would leave task 8's authority rule resting on
#: a premise this module had quietly stopped honouring.
#:
#: Narrowed rather than left, because the two ways of resolving it are not
#: symmetrical. Narrowing costs a school an inconvenience a later PR can undo;

    this codebase has hit before — see `schools.Invitation.accept()`, which was
    validating guards against rows it had not locked.

    `.order_by()` is **belt and braces, and the braces are Django's.** The
    concern is real and this codebase has been bitten by it three times — in
    `accounts.services`, `accounts.models` and `schools.invitations` — because
    `ResultSheet` sorts by `term` then `class_group`, both relations, and a
    joined `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` locks a row in *every* joined table. A
    transition would then hold an exclusive lock on the term and the class,
    serialising two principals approving two different classes in one term on a
    row neither of them writes.

    It is not what happens here, and the reason is worth writing down rather
    than rediscovering: **`QuerySet.get()` already clears ordering itself.**
    Django 5.2's `get()` runs `clone = clone.order_by()` before compiling, so
    the lock this function takes is

        SELECT ... FROM results_resultsheet WHERE id = %s LIMIT 21 FOR UPDATE

    with no join, with or without the call below. That was checked by reading
    the SQL the tests actually captured, not by reasoning from `.filter()` —
    which does *not* clear ordering and which is where the intuition comes from.

    The call stays because it costs nothing and the property is one line away
    from being lost: `.filter(pk=...).first()` keeps the ordering, and so does
    anything that stops going through `get()`. `tests/LockScopeTests` pins the
    property rather than the spelling — both of its tests fail on that rewrite,
    one on the SQL and one on real contention for `academics_term`.

    The hole this closes, and it was live in the chain as merged (issue #25):
    `_require_authority()` asks `roles_at(school)`, which is school-wide, and
    nothing bound the actor to the `class_group` on the sheet. Any teacher could
    submit any class group's results, for any term, and the transition row would
    record them as the submitting signatory of a class they do not teach — an
    audit trail accurate about who acted and silent about their having had no
    standing to act.

    **`sheet` must be the row read under the lock**, never the instance the
    caller passed in. That is the module docstring's rule and this check was the
    one place that broke it: it read `class_group` and `term` off the caller's
    object while `_move()` wrote to the row `_locked()` fetched by `pk` alone. A
    mismatched instance — deserialised, cached, or holding a `class_group` a
    bulk `.update()` has since corrected, none of which any guard prevents — was
    therefore authorised against one group and applied to another. See
    `tests/test_class_teacher_scope.TheScopeIsCheckedOnTheLockedRowTests`, which
    submits JSS 3B on JSS 1A's authority with the check taking its old argument.

    **An administrator is unaffected**, and that is deliberate rather than an
    oversight. `SUBMITTING_ROLES` admits ADMIN on the stated reasoning that
    entering and submitting a paper sheet is office work in most schools; an
    administrator is not a teacher of anything, so "which class are they the
    class teacher of" is not a question about them. Narrowing the office path is
    a separate decision from scoping the teaching one, and would be a change to
    make deliberately.

    A group with **nobody assigned** refuses every teacher, which is the honest
    reading: an unassigned class has no class teacher, so nobody is it. That is a
