"""The broadsheet: a class's marks, averages and positions, for staff.

One endpoint, and its whole design is the audience. **Position is staff-only**,
and that is a rule about who may see the number rather than about where it is
printed:

> Nigerian secondary schools do not print position on report cards. Parents and
> students see the cumulative average only. Schools use position internally, so
> it is computed and (at release) frozen — but it must not reach a parent or a
> student, in a card *or in a payload*.

Enforced here at the **router**, which is the earliest place it can be. A field
omitted from a template while the JSON still carries it is the same leak with an
extra step, and the way that happens is a family-facing view reusing a schema
that was written for staff. There is no schema in this module a family-facing
route could reuse: `PositionOut` and `BroadsheetOut` are only ever produced
behind `_require_position_authority()`.

The parent- and student-facing surfaces — the report card (task 6) and the
unauthenticated result checker — do not exist yet, and when they do they must be
built from their own schemas rather than by filtering these. That is
[issue #21](https://github.com/adedejimakinde/luffy-school-saas/issues/21).

**No school slug in the path**, for the reason `gradebook.api` sets out at
length: these are tenant tables, `TenantMainMiddleware` has already chosen the
schema from the hostname, and a slug would be a second opinion free to disagree
with the connection.
