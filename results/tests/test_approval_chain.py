"""The chain a term's results walk, and the five things it must not allow.

Every fixture builds **two schools**, both as real schemas. A single-tenant test
here cannot fail for the thing most likely to be wrong — a sheet, an audit row
or an authority check reaching across a schema boundary — and the actor is an
`accounts.User` in the *shared* schema, so "which school is this person a vice
principal of" is a genuinely cross-schema question.

Sections, one per property:

- the forward path records who and when, as rows;
- a sheet can be sent back, with a reason, from every stage but released;
- one person cannot take two steps on one pass, in the service *and* in the
  database;
- released is terminal, in the database and not only in a docstring;
- the log cannot be edited or deleted, by the model or by raw SQL.

Concurrency lives in `test_approval_concurrency.py`, which needs real threads.
