"""Two people pressing approve at the same instant, and what each lock reaches.

`approve()` is read-modify-write on one row: read the state, decide the move is
legal, write the transition and the new state. Both requests read `checked`,
both find the move legal, and both proceed.

**What each defence actually does was measured, and it is not what it looks
like.** Removing `select_for_update()` and re-running these tests gives:

    IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint
    "one_transition_to_each_state_per_cycle"
    DETAIL: Key (sheet_id, cycle, to_state)=(1, 0, approved) already exists.

So the *constraint* is what prevents the double approval — even unlocked, the
audit never gains a second approver. The *lock* is what turns the loser's
outcome from an unhandled `IntegrityError` — a 500 on a principal's screen,
with nothing said about what happened — into a `WrongState` naming the state
the sheet is now in. Two layers, two different jobs, and it would have been easy
to write the lock's docstring claiming the constraint's job.

That distinction is why `test_only_one_of_two_simultaneous_approvals_succeeds`
asserts on **both** halves: one row in the audit, *and* the loser holding a
refusal it can act on.

`LockScopeTests` at the foot asks the other question about the same lock — not
"does it serialise the right pair" but **"what else does it stop?"** A joined
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` locks a row in every joined table, so an ordering that
walks a foreign key silently puts an exclusive lock on rows the transition never
writes. This codebase has fixed that bug three times in other apps. It is *not*
present here — `QuerySet.get()` clears ordering itself — and those tests carry
the measurement that settled it, along with the one-line rewrite that brings the
bug back and fails them both.

`TransactionTestCase` and real threads, on the reasoning
`accounts/tests/test_signin_concurrency.py` sets out: two connections whose
commits are visible to each other, released together by a barrier rather than
interleaved with sleeps, so both attempts are provably in flight.

**Two schools, both real schemas**, as everywhere else in this project. The
race itself is between two connections on one row and needs only one school —
that was the argument for building one here, and it was wrong, because it is not
the only thing these tests can catch. Each thread resolves its own school from
`connection.schema_name`, so a thread whose `search_path` is wrong would
authorise against one school and write into another's schema, and no
single-tenant test can tell that apart from working correctly.

    Postgres locks a row in *each* joined table unless told `OF`. Every submit,
    check, approve, release and send-back would then take an exclusive lock on
    the term row and the class row, neither of which a transition writes: two
    principals approving two *different* classes in one term would serialise on
    the shared `academics_term` row, and a transition would contend with
    anything else touching that term — flipping `Term.is_current`, for instance.
