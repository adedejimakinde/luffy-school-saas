"""Who can see a position, asked of the HTTP surface rather than the function.

The rule is not a rendering preference and cannot be enforced in a template:

> Position is **staff-only**. It must not reach a parent or a student, in a card
> or in a payload. Enforced at the serializer, because omitting a field from a
> card while leaving it in the JSON is the same leak with an extra step.

So these tests ask the endpoint, through the real middleware stack, as each kind
of caller — and the parent's and student's assertions are about the *bytes that
came back*, not about a flag. `assertNotIn("position", response.content)` is
deliberately cruder than parsing: a leak that renamed the field, nested it, or
put it in an error body would still be a leak, and a structural assertion on
parsed JSON would walk straight past it.

Not `RequestFactory`, for the reason `gradebook/tests/test_api.py` gives: these
are tenant tables and `TenantMainMiddleware` chooses the schema from the
hostname. A test that skipped it would be querying whichever schema the
connection was left on.

Two schools, both with hosts, because "can St Mary's principal read Grace
Academy's broadsheet" is a question about the middleware and the authority check
together, and neither one alone answers it.
