"""The gradebook: what a mark means, what it refuses, and who wins a tie.

Tenant-scoped, so every test runs inside a real school schema with the real
tables, copied from one migrated once for the run rather than migrated again
per test. See docs/tenancy.md for why a plain `TestCase` is the right harness
for that, and `schools/tests/test_tenant_template.py` for what makes a copy
usable as the real thing.

Three properties carry the module, and each has a section:

- a row exists if and only if somebody has been marked, so "not marked yet" and
  "scored zero" are never the same fact;
- no total is stored anywhere, so no total can be stale;
- every write is conditional on the version the writer was shown, so two
  teachers with one sheet open cannot silently overwrite each other.

        the INSERT. It fails at COMMIT — and *where* that lands depends on who
