"""The three marking-sheet endpoints, exercised the way a blur uses them.

Not `RequestFactory`: these go through the Django test client so that
`TenantMainMiddleware` and `SchoolAccessMiddleware` actually run. For the
gradebook that is not incidental — the tenant middleware is what chooses the
*schema* these tables live in, and it chooses it from the hostname. So every
request here carries a school's own host, and `setUp` registers one. A test that
skipped the middleware would be querying whichever schema the connection
happened to be left on, which is the one thing the routing is built to prevent.

The portal host is registered too, because "there is no gradebook here" is a
behaviour worth pinning rather than a state left untested.

The sections follow the interaction: read a sheet, save one cell, take one back.
The retry section is the one carrying the weight — blur fires more than once for
a single edit, and a version check that calls the second firing a conflict makes
the conflict warning worthless by crying wolf at a teacher working alone.
