"""A teacher whose session lapses in the middle of a marking sheet.

The story this branch exists for, told end to end: a teacher marks a few cells,
their session goes, the next blur is refused, they sign in again, and the browser
sends the refused mark a second time. Nothing may be lost and nothing may be
counted twice.

The server does not hold the unsent mark anywhere, and deliberately so — writing
it would need the authority that just lapsed, and a server-side draft store is a
second copy of the gradebook with none of its rules. What the server owes instead
is that **replaying is safe**, which is not a new promise: every write is already
conditional on the version the teacher was shown, and
`_is_our_write_arriving_twice()` already recognises a repeat of the caller's own
write. This module holds that line across a re-login, which is the one place it
could quietly stop being true — the retry is the *same person* but a *different
session*, and a rule keyed on the session rather than the person would break here
and nowhere else.

Session policy itself — how long a session lasts, what the 401 body says — is in
`accounts/tests/test_session.py`.
