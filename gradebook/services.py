"""Entering and clearing marks. The only supported way to write a `Score`.

Two functions, because there are only two things a teacher does to a mark:
they set it, or they take it back. There is deliberately no `create_sheet()`
and no "initialise this class's scores" — a sheet is thirty students and
however many of them have been marked, and materialising rows for the rest is
the thing `models.py` exists to prevent.

Every write goes through `set_score()`, and every one of them answers the same
three questions before touching the table:

1. **Is this child ours?** `student_membership_id` is a bare id with no foreign
   key (docs/tenancy.md), so the column will take any integer, including a
   child at another school. Asked here because it cannot be asked in SQL.
2. **Can the assessment hold this mark?** A value above `max_score` is a
   percentage over 100 somewhere downstream. A cross-row rule, so no check
   constraint can express it.
3. **Is the mark still what the teacher was shown?** Two teachers with the same
   sheet open is ordinary. Every write is conditional on the `version` the
   caller was handed, and a stale one is refused rather than applied on top of
   whoever moved first.

A fourth question — **may this person mark at all?** — is asked only by the
`_as()` variants at the foot of this module, on the idiom `accounts.services`
set: the plain functions are primitives an import or a data migration can use,
and anything with a request behind it goes through `set_score_as()`. Authority
is the one rule that cannot live in the primitive, because a management command
has no actor to check.

Still no screens and no HTTP here, for the same reason `fees.services` has
none: the other three rules have to hold for an import too, and a rule that
lives in a view only holds for the view. `gradebook/api.py` is a caller of this
module, not a second place the rules are written.

    Asked of the frozen rows, and **placement never enters into it**.
    `_require_the_sheet_is_open()` below reaches the sheet through
    `placement.class_group` — the class the child is in *today* — so releasing
    JSS 1A and then moving the child to JSS 3B leaves it looking at JSS 3B's
    untouched draft and permitting a write onto a card already in a parent's
    hand. `results.ratings._require_this_card_has_not_gone_home()` and
    `results.comments._require_this_card_has_not_gone_home()` are the same guard
    one and two tables over: **a guard on a released artefact keys off the
    artefact, not off the child's current placement**, because placement is a
    live fact that changes while release is an event that happened.

    **This was written up as unclosable, and it was not.** The first draft of
    this module justified the placement key with "nothing freezes marks until
    task 3", and that conflated two different claims. Nothing freezes the
    *marks* — true, and still task 3's to fix. But the guarantee being enforced
    here is *a card went home for this child*, and `ReleasedTraitRating` answers
    exactly that: one row per child per visible trait, written by
    `ratings.freeze_for_release()` inside the same transaction that writes the
    release row. Whether the marks were frozen has no bearing on whether the
    release is knowable, and `0011` was already keying on it one table over.

    **What is left is a per-school gap, not a per-child one.**
    `freeze_for_release()` returns early when no group is enabled and again when
    no trait is visible, so a school with the conduct section off freezes
    nothing for anybody and this finds nothing to refuse with. That residue — a
    ratings-disabled release, for a child who is then moved — is what the
    unconditional per-child marker required by
    [issue #34](https://github.com/adedejimakinde/luffy-school-saas/issues/34)
    closes, and it is the same residue `ratings` documents for the same reason.

    The seam this closes: the approval chain and the gradebook were built in the
    right order and never introduced, so a mark could be changed at any point
    after the chain left `draft` — including after release, which means a parent
    holding a card the database now disagrees with, with no revision and no
    audit row. `results` makes release terminal for the sheet's *state*; this is
    what makes it terminal for its *contents*.

    **A late import, and it is not stylistic.** `results` already imports this
    app — `results/api.py` for `Subject`, `results/positions.py` for `Score` —
    so a module-level import here would make the two apps mutually dependent at
    the package level. It happens to work today because `results/services.py`
    imports nothing from `gradebook`, but that is a fact about which module the
    edge lands on rather than a layering that holds. Deferring it to call time
    keeps the import graph honest at module scope and costs one dict lookup on
    a path that is already doing a locking query.

    Moving `ResultSheet` down into `academics` would resolve it properly and is
    a larger change than the bug being fixed; a released result is editable
    today, and a cleanliness concern should not gate a correctness fix. The
    import is reversible where the model move is not.

    **The sheet is locked, not merely read**, and the caller writes the mark in
    the same transaction — `results.services.locked_sheet_for()` is the same
    `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` that `ratings._require_the_sheet_is_open()` takes.
    Unlocked, this is a check followed by an act on what it checked: a teacher
    pressing save while the vice principal presses submit would find the sheet
    in `draft` and commit a mark into a document submitted a millisecond later,
    leaving the signature attached to a sheet nobody signed.

    **A child with no placement is not refused.** Entering a mark has never
    required one, and adding that requirement here would be a different change
    with its own argument; no placement means no class, which means no sheet
    governs the mark. It is also the honest answer: there is nothing this
    function could be checking against.

    **Why this keys on the placement, and what stands in front of it.** `Score`
    reaches a class only through `academics.ClassPlacement`, because an
    assessment belongs to a `(term, subject)` and is sat by every class taught
    that subject. So this asks where the child sits *today*, which is the wrong
    key for a released card and the only key available here.
    `_require_this_card_has_not_gone_home()` runs first and asks the right one,
    off the frozen artefact — so a moved child reaches this function only at a
    school whose conduct section is off. That function has what is left and why
    [issue #34](https://github.com/adedejimakinde/luffy-school-saas/issues/34)
    is what closes it.

    **The pre-sheet race, which the lock above does not close.**
    `locked_sheet_for()` returns `None` and locks nothing when no sheet exists,
    so the ordering promised above is a guarantee about sheets that *exist*. A
    mark begun before anybody opens the class's sheet can still land after
    somebody else opens *and* submits it in the same window. Closing that needs
    a lock on something other than the row;
    `results.ratings._require_the_sheet_is_open()` carries the identical residue
    and files it as
    [issue #30](https://github.com/adedejimakinde/luffy-school-saas/issues/30).
    This is that same race, not a second one.

    Returns nothing. The sheet it looked at is deliberately not handed back:
    neither caller needs it, and returning it would imply the mark is written
    against that row rather than merely permitted by it.

    """Take back a mark. Returns nothing; the row is gone.

    A delete, not a zero and not a null. That is the module's whole premise:
    "not marked yet" is the absence of a row, so un-marking is removing one. A
    teacher who clears a mark and a teacher who enters 0 have said two different
    things, and the table has to keep them apart.

    `expected_version` is required — there is no default, because "clear
    whatever is there" is exactly the destructive write the version exists to
    prevent, and it is not worth a convenient spelling. `ANY_VERSION` is
    accepted for the callers that genuinely have no sheet.

    Clearing a mark that is already gone is a no-op rather than an error: the
    end state the caller asked for is the end state that holds, and a retried
    request should not fail because it succeeded the first time.

    **That promise survives the sheet guard, and it took an ordering to keep
    it.** The guards run *after* the check for a mark to delete, not before. Run
    first, they would refuse a retried DELETE of an already-cleared mark on a
    sheet that has since been submitted — the request whose whole point is that
    it is safe to send twice, failing precisely because it worked the first
    time. There is nothing for a released card to protect in that case: no row
    is being written, and the end state is the one the caller asked for.

    The existence check is unversioned on purpose. A row that is present at some
    *other* version is still a mark on a closed sheet, so it is `MarksLocked`
    and not `ScoreChangedMeanwhile`: telling that caller to reload and retry
    sends them round a loop that cannot terminate, because the sheet is what
    refused them and reloading does not reopen it.
