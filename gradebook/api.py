"""HTTP for a marking sheet: read it, save one mark, take one back.

Three endpoints, and their shape is decided by one interaction. A teacher
marking a class of thirty does not fill in a form and press Save at the bottom.
They tab through thirty cells, and each one has to save as it loses focus —
because the alternative is a teacher who spends twenty minutes marking, loses
the tab, and loses the lot. Every choice below follows from that:

**One mark per request.** Blur fires per cell, so the unit of a write is a
single student's mark on a single assessment, not a sheet. There is no bulk
save endpoint and a sheet is not a transaction: thirty independent writes is
what actually happened, and it is what should be recorded.

**Every write answers with the new version and the recomputed total.** Those
are the two things on the screen that a save invalidates. Returning them in the
response the client already has to wait for is what makes "refresh the total
before display" true by construction rather than by the client remembering to
ask again — and a client that never issues a second request cannot forget to.

**A conflict is a body, not a bare status.** `ScoreChangedMeanwhile` carries the
row as it now stands, so the 409 does too. "Somebody else changed this" is not
useful to a teacher; "Kemi entered 17 while you were typing" is, and the client
cannot say the second without being told what the mark now is.

**A closed sheet is a 423, and it is neither of the two codes it looks like.**
`MarksLocked` says the term has left `draft` — submitted, checked, approved or
released — so the mark cannot be written now and, for a released term, cannot
be written ever. It is not a **409**: in this API that code means "somebody
changed this while you were typing", and the client answers it by reloading the
cell and sending again. A blur handler doing that against a released sheet
retries for ever, because nothing it can reload will reopen the term. It is not
a **403** either: the caller's authority has not changed and is not the
problem — a teacher who could mark this child an hour ago still can, once the
sheet is sent back. What changed is the state of the resource, which is what
423 is for.

The same reasoning applies to `results.ratings.RatingsLocked` and
`results.comments.CommentsLocked`, which are the same refusal about the other
two thirds of the same card. Neither has an HTTP surface yet — `results.api`
exposes one read-only broadsheet route — and when they get one it is this code,
so that one refusal does not arrive as three.

**No school slug in any path**, unlike the `/api/schools/{slug}/...` invitation
routes. Those write shared tables, where the school is a row that has to be
named. The gradebook is a tenant app: its tables live in the school's own
schema, and `TenantMainMiddleware` has already chosen that schema from the
hostname before any code here runs. A slug in the path would be a *second*
opinion about which school this is, free to disagree with the connection — and
a disagreement means authorising against one school and writing into another's
schema. `services._require_student_of_this_school()` reads the connection for
exactly this reason; the routing does the same thing by having nothing to read.
