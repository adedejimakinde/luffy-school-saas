"""How an invite token reaches the person it was minted for.

Deliberately not on `Invitation`. The model's job is to know whether a token is
good; getting it to a human is a different concern with a different lifetime —
this pass sends staff invitations by email, and parents will want WhatsApp,
which is a channel with its own templates, credentials, failure modes and
regulatory rules. If `Invitation.send()` existed, adding that second channel
would mean opening the model.

So a channel is anything with `send(invitation, raw_token, *, accept_url)`, and
optionally a `check_deliverable(invitation)` that answers whether this person is
reachable at all without sending anything. `invitations.py` resolves one and
calls it; nothing in `models.py` imports this module at all, and the dependency
deliberately points this way only.

Note what a channel is handed and what it is not: the **raw token**, which is
never persisted, and never the `Invitation` row's `token_hash`. A channel is the
one place the raw token legitimately exists outside the mint, which is also why
`EmailChannel` puts it in a link and keeps no copy.

    finished being set up", not "that person is unreachable".

    Deliberately not an `InvitationError` either. That hierarchy means "the flow

    dispatches through `transaction.on_commit` — so by the time this is raised
    the invitation, its membership and any placeholder account are committed and
    cannot be undone.

    That is the right outcome rather than a regrettable one: the invitation
    exists and can be resent once mail is healthy, and re-running the invite is
    idempotent (`_issue()` revokes the stale token and mints a fresh one). The
    thing worth being careful about is only that the admin is *told*, which is
