"""The tenant itself, and the invitations that bring people into one.

`School` and `Domain` are django_tenants plumbing. `Invitation` is here for a
less obvious reason: it lives in the **public** schema, like `Membership` and
for the same cause. An invitation is a (person, school, role) triple, and the
person half is global — a teacher at St Mary's invited to Grace Academy is one
`accounts.User` gaining a second `Membership`, not a new account. A per-school
invitations table could not express that without reaching across schemas, which
is the pattern `docs/tenancy.md` still blocks.

Being shared is also what lets the foreign keys below be real foreign keys,
with real referential integrity, exactly as `Membership.user` is.

        `is_active` is in the query for the same two reasons at the `User` level.
        Deactivation takes away a person's access without erasing anything, so a
        link minted before it must stop working; and the holder learns only that
        the link is dead, not that the account behind it was disabled.

        Expiry is settled here rather than by a scheduled job. An invitation is
        only ever looked at when someone presents its token, so the lazy sweep
        is enough, and it means a row cannot sit in PENDING past its date while
        a cron job is broken.
