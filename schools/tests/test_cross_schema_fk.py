"""What a real tenant→shared ForeignKey actually does, measured end to end.

docs/tenancy.md carries a hard blocker: the next tenant-scoped model must not
add a ForeignKey back to `accounts` until the policy is decided. That blocker
was originally written from hand-authored DDL matching what `sqlmigrate`
prints, which confirmed the *mechanism* but left the ORM ergonomics inferred
from the deletion collector's design rather than observed. This file closes
that gap with real Django models, a real ForeignKey and a real `.delete()`.

Every `user.delete()` below runs inside `_sanctioned_delete()`. That is not the
subject of these tests — it is how they reach past `accounts.deletion`'s
`pre_delete` guard, which now refuses an unsanctioned delete before any of this
can happen. What is measured here is what Django and Postgres do underneath that
policy, and it is the reason the policy exists; lifting the guard deliberately,
in the one file that documents the failure, keeps that evidence readable.

Why the probe models are defined here instead of in academics/models.py:
shipping a tenant→shared ForeignKey is exactly what the blocker forbids, so
these must not exist in any migration or reach any real schema. They are
registered in the real app registry for the life of this test class only —
which is what makes `User._meta.related_objects` see them and the collector
behave as it would in production — and their tables are built directly with
`schema_editor` inside the test transaction. Nothing survives the class.

        docs/tenancy.md now settles on **option 2**: tenant tables reference
        shared rows by bare id and never by foreign key, because everything
        measured in this file says a cross-schema `on_delete` does not mean what
        it says. That decision was a paragraph in a document, which is the kind
        of rule somebody adds a `ForeignKey` straight through without reading.

        So: every foreign key in a real school's schema must point at a table in
        *that same schema*. Tenant→tenant is fine and `fees.FeeLedgerEntry` uses
        two of them; tenant→`public` is the thing forbidden. The probe tables are
        excluded because breaking the rule on purpose is their entire job.

        If this fails, the fix is almost certainly to replace the new foreign key
        with a bare id column and a service-layer check — not to relax this test.
