"""The staff invitation flow, end to end.

The case worth watching throughout is the second one: a person who already has
an account being invited to another school. docs/membership.md warns that a
flow written as "invite ⇒ create account" breaks exactly the case this data
model exists to serve, so several tests below exist only to pin that an existing
`User` is reused, keeps their password, and is never asked for a new one.

These are plain `TestCase`s against the public schema. Every model in the flow —
`User`, `Membership`, `Invitation` — is shared, so no schema switching is needed
and none is done; `make_school()` here skips `CREATE SCHEMA` for the same reason
`accounts/tests/test_membership.py` does.
