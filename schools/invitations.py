"""Inviting staff into a school: the rules that span identity and membership.

The model knows whether a token is good. The delivery module knows how to reach
a person. This is where the flow lives — resolving who is being invited, giving
them an INVITED membership, minting the token and handing it to a channel.

The thing worth reading carefully is `resolve_invitee()`. Identity is global
here: one `User` per person for the life of their relationship with the
platform, no matter how many schools they end up at. So inviting somebody is
mostly a question of *whether they already exist*, and getting that wrong in the
direction of "create a new account" is how a teacher ends up with two logins and
a parent loses sight of one of their children.
