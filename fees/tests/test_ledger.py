"""The fee ledger: what it stores, what it refuses, and what it cannot forget.

Tenant-scoped, so every test runs inside a real school schema with the real
tables, copied from one migrated once for the run rather than migrated again
per test. The append-only trigger this module leans on comes across with the
copy — `schools/tests/clone_tenant_schema.sql` carries functions and triggers
for exactly this reason, and an earlier version of it that did not was caught
by `schools/tests/test_tenant_template.py`. See docs/tenancy.md for why a plain
`TestCase` is the right harness for any of it.

Three properties are worth more than the rest, and each has a section:

- money is whole kobo and the sign carries the meaning, so a balance is a sum;
- an entry is never edited and never deleted, enforced in Postgres and not only
  in Python;
- a correction is a new row that names what it undoes.
