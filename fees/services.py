"""Posting to the fee ledger. The only supported way to write one.

Four functions, one per thing that can happen to a family's account: they are
charged, they pay, they are given a discount, or somebody made a mistake and it
is undone. There is deliberately no general "adjust" — see `reverse_entry()`.

Everything here takes the caller's *student membership id* rather than a
`Membership` object, because the ledger stores a bare id and the two must not
drift apart. `snapshot_student()` is the one place that turns a live membership
into the frozen identity an entry carries.

No screens, no HTTP. This is the data layer the eventual bursar's screen will
call, and keeping the rules here rather than in a view is what makes them true
for an import and a management command too.
