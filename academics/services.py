"""Putting a child in a class, and moving them. The only supported way to write
a `ClassPlacement`.

Three things a school does to a placement: it makes one, it changes one, and it
carries a term's worth forward into the next term. Each is a separate function
because each is a different act with a different failure — and in particular
**placing and moving are not the same call**. `place_student()` refuses a child
who is already placed that term rather than quietly reassigning them: a silent
reassignment is a position in class changing under a report card that has
already been printed, and it is precisely the kind of write that should have to
be spelled.

Every write answers the same question first, on the idiom `fees.services` and
`gradebook.services` established: **is this child ours?** `student_membership_id`
is a bare id with no foreign key (docs/tenancy.md), so the column will take any
integer, including a child at another school. The rule itself now lives in
`accounts.students` — this module is the third caller, which is the trigger
`gradebook.services.NotThisSchoolsStudent` named for moving it there.

Authority is asked only by the `_as()` variants at the foot of the module, the
same split `gradebook.services` uses: the plain functions are primitives an
import or a data migration can call, and anything with a request behind it goes
through `place_student_as()`. A management command has no actor to check, so
authority cannot live in the primitive.

No screens and no HTTP here, for the reason the other two service modules have
none: the rules have to hold for an import too, and a rule that lives in a view
only holds for the view.

    `IntegrityError` is the table refusing a row and says nothing about *which*

    which is what `AlreadyPlaced` describes and what a caller fixes by reloading.
    Reporting any other failure that way would send a caller looking for a
    placement that does not exist, and bury the real fault behind a
    routine-looking refusal.

    Which other failures can actually arrive here was measured rather than
    assumed, and the answer is narrower than it looks. Django declares
    PostgreSQL foreign keys `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`, so a placement
    naming a `ClassGroup` or `Term` that does not exist **does not raise here at

    pins that, because it is the sort of thing that changes under you: were a
    future migration to make those keys immediate, the guard below is what keeps
    them from being relabelled as a conflict.

    What does arrive here immediately is the unique constraint and the check
    constraints on the two positive-integer columns.

    Asked of the constraint that actually fired, via psycopg2's `diag`, rather
