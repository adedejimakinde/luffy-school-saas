"""School-owned academic records. The first app that lives in TENANT_APPS.

Everything here is created once **per school schema**, not once for the
platform. That is the whole difference from `accounts`: an `accounts.User`
row is one person across every school, while a `Term` row below belongs to
exactly one school and is not merely hidden from the others — it is in a
different Postgres schema and therefore not on their connection's
`search_path` at all. See docs/tenancy.md.

Holds **no foreign key into `accounts`**, and never will. That is not an
oversight: `on_delete` is resolved against whichever schema the connection is
on, so a tenant→shared key gives `PROTECT` that does not protect and `CASCADE`
that cascades one school's rows only. docs/tenancy.md records what was measured.

`Term` originally held no foreign keys *at all*, which was true of it because
it pointed at nothing. `ClassPlacement` below points at two things and settles
the question the way `fees.FeeLedgerEntry` and `gradebook.Score` already had:
**real foreign keys between tables in the same schema, a bare id across the
schema boundary**, with the check that earns the bare id made in
`academics.services` before anything is written.

    Not `F("later") - F("earlier")`, which is the obvious spelling and does not
    work here. Django reads a subtraction of two `DateField`s as a *duration*
    and renders `interval '1 day' * ("later" - "earlier")` — even wrapped in
    `ExpressionWrapper(output_field=IntegerField())`, which looks like it should
    settle the question and does not. Postgres then refuses the surrounding
    arithmetic outright (`operator does not exist: interval + integer`), so a
    check constraint written that way fails when the *schema* is created, taking
    every term at every school with it.

    A subclass rather than a `Func(...)` instance with `template=` and
    `arg_joiner=` passed in, and that is not style. Those two arrive as
    `**extra`, a dict whose key order lands in the expression's identity — so an
    instance built here and the identical instance reconstructed from a
    migration compare **unequal**, and `makemigrations` proposes dropping and
    recreating the constraint on every single run, forever. As class attributes
    they never enter `extra` at all, and the round-trip is stable. CI runs
    `makemigrations --check`, so the symptom would have been a permanently red
