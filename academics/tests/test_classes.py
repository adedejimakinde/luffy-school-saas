"""Which class a child sits in, and the two numbers that depend on it.

`ClassGroup` and `ClassPlacement` exist so that "position in class" and "class
average" have a denominator. Everything here is therefore about one property or
another of that denominator being trustworthy:

- a group belongs to one school, and two schools may both have a "JSS 1A";
- a child sits in exactly **one** group per term, enforced by the database and
  not only by the service;
- a child at another school cannot be placed here at all, which is the check
  that earns the bare `student_membership_id`;
- carrying a term forward does not overwrite work already done by hand.

**Two schools in every fixture, never one.** A single-tenant test cannot fail
for any of the reasons this table is most likely to be got wrong: a uniqueness
constraint that should be per-schema, a roster query missing its `term` filter,
a placement written on the wrong connection. St Mary's and Grace Academy are
both real schemas, created the production way.
