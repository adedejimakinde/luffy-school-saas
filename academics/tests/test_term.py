"""The `Term` record, and the four things Postgres refuses to store.

`Term` is tenant-scoped, so these run inside a real school schema rather than
against `public` — `academics_term` does not exist there at all, which is the
whole point of `docs/tenancy.md` and is asserted directly in
`schools/tests/test_tenant_isolation.py`. `make_school()` here therefore builds
a real schema with the real tables — copied from a schema migrated once for the
run rather than migrated again for each of these tests, which is the same
structure for a fraction of the time. `schools/tests/test_tenant_template.py`
is what holds "the same structure" up.

Every rule below is a database constraint rather than a `clean()` check, for the
reason `docs/tenancy.md` already gives about the one-current-term index: a rule
that lives only in Python is a rule a data import, a shell session or a future
service function walks straight around.
