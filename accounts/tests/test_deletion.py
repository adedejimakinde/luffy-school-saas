"""Proof that a User cannot be hard-deleted out from under a reference.

The interesting case is the one no database constraint catches. A tenant-scoped
row in Grace Academy's schema referencing a shared user is invisible to a
connection pointed at St Mary's, so `on_delete=PROTECT` raises nothing and the
delete only comes apart at `COMMIT`. That was measured in PR #3
(`schools/tests/test_cross_schema_fk.py`); this file shows `hard_delete_user()`
catching what `PROTECT` misses, and does it with the same probe-model pattern —
real Django models with a real ForeignKey into `public`, registered for the life
of the test class only, with their tables built by `schema_editor` inside the
test transaction. They must not reach a migration: shipping a tenant→shared
ForeignKey is still the thing `docs/tenancy.md` forbids.
