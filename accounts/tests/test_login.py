"""Signing in: where it is served, what it refuses, and what it will not say.

Three things are being pinned here, and they are worth separating because they
fail differently.

**Where.** Sign-in is on the portal host only. That is the decision that makes
one login reach every school a person belongs to, and it is testable directly:
the same request is a 200 on the portal and a 404 on a school's host.

**What it will not say.** A sign-in route is the easiest place in a platform to
build an account-existence oracle, because every reason to refuse is a fact
somebody would like to know. The tests below compare whole responses rather than
status codes — no account, wrong password and deactivated account must be
indistinguishable, and so must a throttled attempt against a real identifier and
one against an invented one.

**The throttle.** Counted, not locked. The tests hold both halves of that: the
window closes, and it opens again on its own without anybody being unlocked.

`SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` is the one part of this that a test client cannot
honestly exercise — Django's client sends every cookie it holds to every host it
is pointed at, so a session arriving at a school host proves the *session* is
good there, not that a browser would have sent it. What the cookie is stamped
with is asserted directly instead, and the deployment rule that it must be
stamped at all is `accounts.checks.session_cookie_spans_every_host()`.

    **Two schools in every test here, and that is the point rather than
    thoroughness.** The thing most likely to be got wrong about a per-school
    answer is that it is not per-school — a boolean computed once for the login
    and repeated on every row would pass every single-tenant test written for
    it. So the shape throughout is one person, two schools, two different
    answers.

    Each boolean is the **same question the surface behind the link asks**:
    `may_take_a_register` is `attendance.services.can_mark_attendance()`, and
    `has_children_here` is `card_api._children_of()`'s predicate. Neither is a
    role, because in both cases the role is the near-enough thing —
    `api._schools_of()` sets out which way each one is wrong.
