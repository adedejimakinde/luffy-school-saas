"""The transfer handshake: two schools, two signatures, one transaction.

The thing under test is not really "does a child end up at the right school" —
`transfer_student()` already did that. It is *who was allowed to make it happen*,
and what the record says afterwards. So most of these tests are about authority
and about the row, and the ones that check the child's school are checking that
the two-sided path reaches the same end state the both-ends-at-once path does.

The case worth watching is `test_the_requesting_school_cannot_answer_itself` and
its platform-staff sibling. A handshake that one party can complete alone is not
a handshake, and the failure would be invisible in the data: the transfer would
be correct, and only the record would quietly be worth less than it claims.
