"""Exchanging credentials for a session.

The missing half of "handle session expiry mid-form-entry". The API can already
tell a client that its session lapsed and that the refused request is safe to
send again; until this existed there was nowhere to send the credentials that
would make that true, and the only real sign-in form on the platform was Django
admin's.

`IdentifierBackend` already does the resolving, and does the part that matters
for disclosure: a missing account is charged the same password hash as a real
one, so "no such person" and "wrong password" do not differ in how long they
take. This module is what sits around that — the throttle, and the single
refusal that every failure shares.

**One refusal, whatever went wrong.** No account, wrong password, deactivated
account, two accounts matching one identifier: all four answer with the same
status, the same code and the same sentence. Splitting them is the standing
temptation on a sign-in route and it is how a login endpoint becomes an
account-existence oracle — every email and phone number on the platform, one
guess at a time, with no credential needed. The invitation routes answer a bad
token with a flat 404 for the same reason, and `accounts/session.py` explains
why the 401 on *expiry* is a different case that discloses nothing.

The throttle is deliberately outside that rule and does not break it: it is
counted against the identifier as typed, whether or not it resolves to
anybody, so being throttled says nothing about whether the account is real.
Were it counted only for accounts that exist, the 429 would be the oracle the
401 refuses to be.

    Order matters and is the security-relevant part of this function:

    1. **The throttle is asked first**, before any lookup or password hash.
       A closed window has to be closed to everybody, including a caller whose
       next guess happens to be right — checking afterwards would let an
       attacker keep guessing as long as they were willing to read the 429.
    2. **A failure is counted against both keys.** The identifier bounds the
       guesses one account absorbs; the address bounds the guesses one machine
       makes across every account.
    3. **Success clears the identifier and leaves the address alone.** See
       `throttling.clear()` for why the asymmetry is not an oversight.

    `start_session()` is Django's `login()`, which cycles the session key —
    so a session key fixed by an attacker before sign-in is not the key the
    person ends up holding — and rotates the CSRF token with it.
