"""Identity and school access.

Everything here lives in the public schema, once for the whole platform.

The shape to keep in mind:

    User            a person, one login, no role of its own
    Membership      (person, school, role) — the only place a role exists
    Guardianship    (parent user, a child's STUDENT membership)
    TransferRequest one school's proposal to move a child to another, and the
                    other school's answer — two signatures, one transfer

A person is not "a teacher"; a person *is a teacher at a school*, and may
simultaneously be a parent at that school and at two others. So role is an
attribute of the relationship, never of the user.

    `release_student_as()` and `enroll_student_as()` already let two schools move
    a child without either writing at the other, but they are two unconnected
    acts: nothing ties a release to the admission it was meant for, nothing
    records that anyone agreed, and between them the child belongs to no school.
    This is what connects them.

    **The handshake assembles two-sided authority out of two one-sided acts.**
    That is the whole idea, and it is worth stating plainly. `transfer_student()`
    genuinely needs authority at both ends — it ends a membership at one school
    and opens one at the other. Requiring one caller to hold both is what made
    ordinary transfers impossible. So one school signs by *requesting*, the other
    signs by *accepting*, and only when both signatures exist does the transfer
    run — in a single transaction, which is what closes the window the two-act
    path leaves open. Neither side ever acted at the other's school; the pair of
    consents did.

    Either side may initiate. A releasing school saying "we are letting this
    child go to Grace Academy" and a receiving school saying "we would like to
    admit this child from St Mary's" are the same proposal from opposite ends,
    and which one happens first is a fact about the family, not about the model.
    `requested_side` records which it was, because "who asked" is the first
    question anyone will have when a transfer is disputed.

    Points at the child's STUDENT `Membership` rather than repeating the child
    and the school they are leaving. That one foreign key pins both, and it
    cannot drift out of step with the enrolment it is proposing to move — which
    two loose columns could. `student_user` and `from_school` read them back off
    it.
