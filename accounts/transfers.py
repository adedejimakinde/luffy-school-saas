"""The transfer handshake: two schools agreeing to move one child.

`release_student_as()` and `enroll_student_as()` already let two schools move a
child without either writing at the other's school. What they do not do is
connect: nothing ties a release to the admission it was meant for, nothing
records that anybody agreed, and between the two acts the child belongs to no
school at all. This module is what connects them.

The idea worth holding on to is in one sentence: **the handshake assembles
two-sided authority out of two one-sided acts.** `services.transfer_student()`
genuinely needs authority at both ends — it ends a membership at one school and
opens one at another — and requiring a single caller to hold both is exactly
what made ordinary transfers impossible, since a school admin holds one school.
So one school signs by requesting and the other signs by accepting, and only
once both signatures exist does the transfer run, in a single transaction.
Neither side ever acted at the other's school. The pair of consents did.

Either end may ask. "We are letting this child go to Grace Academy" and "we
would like to admit this child from St Mary's" are the same proposal seen from
opposite sides, and which came first is a fact about the family rather than
about the model — so `requested_side` records it, because "who asked" is the
first question anybody has when a transfer is disputed.

Two exception families meet here, and the split is deliberate rather than an
oversight. `TransferError` and its subclasses describe states *of the
handshake* — already answered, nothing left to hand over, wrong end of the
table. `MembershipError` and `NotPermitted`, from `services`, describe what was
already true of memberships before any of this existed, and every other
membership service raises them. A caller that wants "did the handshake refuse?"
catches `TransferError`; one that wants "was this a sensible thing to ask?"
catches the other. Collapsing them would have meant either a circular import or
a second exception wearing a name that already means something else, which is a
mistake this codebase has made once already and documented.
