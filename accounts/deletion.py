"""Removing a person, and why the permanent version is not a method.

The supported way to take away someone's access is `deactivate_user()`, which
clears `is_active`. Nothing is erased: their memberships, their children, the
history of what they did at a school all stay exactly where they were, and
`ModelBackend.user_can_authenticate()` — which `IdentifierBackend` inherits —
refuses the sign-in from that moment on. Reversing it is one field.

Permanently deleting the row is a different thing, and `hard_delete_user()` is
the only way to do it. Two mechanisms, because either alone is not enough:

It is a plain function rather than a manager or queryset method, so a hard
delete cannot be reached by ordinary chaining. That shapes the API but enforces
nothing on its own — `.delete()` still exists on every instance and queryset,
and an earlier version of this module claimed the absence of a manager method as
a safety property when it was only a naming choice.

So `block_unsanctioned_delete()` below refuses any `pre_delete` on `User` unless
`hard_delete_user()` opened the door for it. That is what makes "the only way"
literally true: `user.delete()` in a view, `User.objects.filter(...).delete()`
in a shell, a cascade from somewhere else — all of them raise. The only bypass
is the thread-local sentinel, which is set around exactly one `delete()` call
and restored afterwards.

Why a hard delete needs a guard at all
--------------------------------------
`on_delete` is not a safety net in a schema-per-tenant database. The deletion
collector resolves every relation against the *currently connected* schema, so
deleting a user while pointed at St Mary's cannot see a row in Grace Academy's
schema that references them. `PROTECT` is the worst case: it works by querying
the referencing table, finds nothing from the wrong schema, and lets the delete
through. The transaction then fails at `COMMIT` as an `IntegrityError` naming a
table the connection was never pointed at. That is measured, not assumed — see
`schools/tests/test_cross_schema_fk.py` and the blocker in `docs/tenancy.md`.

So the scan below has to visit each school's schema itself. What it must NOT do
is scan every schema for *shared* models. `accounts` is in `SHARED_APPS` only,
so there is one `accounts_membership` table, in `public`; because
`schema_context` leaves `public` on the `search_path`, querying `Membership`
from inside a tenant just reads that same public table again. Counting it once
per school would report every school on the platform as an offender for a user
who holds a single membership. Hence the split: shared relations are counted
once in `public`, tenant-local relations once per school schema.
