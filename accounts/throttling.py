"""How many times sign-in may be got wrong, and what happens then.

This codebase had no throttle of any kind before the sign-in endpoint existed,
and a login route is the wrong place to introduce the concept casually: it is
the one endpoint whose whole purpose is to accept guesses from people who are
not yet anybody. So the shape is stated here rather than left implicit at the
call site.

**Counted, not locked.** Reaching the limit closes the window for a few
minutes; it never disables an account. A lockout looks like the stronger
control and is in fact a weapon: the identifiers here are semi-public by
design — a school publishes staff email addresses, a parent's phone number is
on the enrolment form, a student's handle is printed on their report card — so
anyone who can read a school's website could hold a teacher out of the
gradebook for as long as they cared to keep typing. Against a ten-character
password floor (`AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`) a few guesses per quarter-hour buys
an attacker nothing, and costs a teacher who has genuinely forgotten their
password a short wait rather than a call to an administrator who may not be in
the building.

**Failures, not attempts.** A successful sign-in is not counted at all, which
is what makes the per-address limit survive contact with a school. A staff room
reaches the internet through one NAT address, so counting every sign-in would
mean the fortieth teacher to arrive at 07:50 is refused for being the fortieth.
Only mistakes accumulate.

**Postgres, not the cache.** There is no `CACHES` entry in this project, so
Django's default is `LocMemCache` — per process. A cache-backed throttle would
therefore count separately in each worker, turning a limit of ten into ten
times however many processes are running, and nothing about it would look
wrong: the setting would read correctly, the tests would pass on a single
process, and the limit would simply not be the limit in production. The
database is the one shared thing this project already deploys.

The cost is a write per failed attempt, which is the cheapest possible traffic
to pay for, and a row per distinct key ever seen. Rows are reset in place
rather than accumulated, so the table is bounded by distinct keys rather than
by attempts; a sweep of long-idle rows is a maintenance job, not a correctness
one, and is left out deliberately rather than half-built.

    `X-Forwarded-For` is written by whoever sent the request until a proxy we

    way to opt out of the per-address limit by inventing an address per
    guess. `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` says how many hops at the *right-hand* end of
    that header this deployment put there; the default of zero means the header
    is ignored entirely and `REMOTE_ADDR` — the only address the socket itself
    can vouch for — is used.

    Setting it too high is the dangerous direction: each extra hop hands one
    more entry back to the caller. It is a deployment fact, so it lives in
    settings rather than being guessed from the request.
