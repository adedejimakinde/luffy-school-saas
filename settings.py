# Sessions
#
# Both settings below are Django defaults being overridden deliberately, so both
# say why. The case that decides them is a teacher marking a class of thirty:
# each cell saves as it loses focus, so a marking session is a long stretch of
# steady small writes rather than one form and one submit.
#
# **The window is idle time, not total time.** Django's default,
# `SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST = False`, runs the clock from the moment of login
# and never extends it however hard the person is working. A teacher who signed
# in near the end of the window gets logged out mid-sheet, cursor still in a
# cell, having saved marks successfully seconds earlier. Sliding the expiry on
# every request is what makes "expired" mean "went away", which is the only
# meaning anybody expects.
#
# The cost is a session write per request, and with one request per blur that is
# thirty writes for one register rather than none. Accepted: the row is small and
# keyed by primary key, and the alternative is losing a teacher's work. If it
# ever shows up in the database's load, the fix is a cached session backend, not
# turning this back off.
#
# **Twelve hours, down from Django's two weeks.** A school day plus room either
# side, so a normal working day never trips it and a session left open on a
# shared staff-room computer is gone by the next morning. Two weeks of *idle*
# time on a machine several teachers use is a long time to leave a signed-in
# gradebook lying around; two weeks of idle time was never the intent, it was
# simply the default nobody had chosen.
#
# Not `SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE`: half of marking is done in a browser
# that is never deliberately closed, and it would put the teacher back where this
# started — logged out at a moment they did not choose.

# **A session belongs to the person, not to one school.** That is not a new

# parent with children at three schools has one login, and
# `SchoolAccessMiddleware` re-derives what they may do from the host on every
# request rather than from anything stored in the session. Writing the school
# into the session would put the same fact in two places, and make the copy in
# the session the stale one the moment a membership is suspended.
#
# What that costs is this setting. Sign-in happens on the portal host (see
# `/api/login/`), and a cookie with no Domain attribute is returned only to the
# exact host that set it — so without a domain spanning the portal and every
# school, a teacher would sign in successfully on the portal and arrive at their
# own school's host as a stranger. Set it to the parent of every host the
# platform answers on, with a leading dot: `.luffy.school`.
#
# Left unset it is not merely unconfigured, it is wrong in a way that only shows
# up on the second host, which is why `accounts/checks.py` refuses a production
# deploy without it rather than letting it be discovered by a teacher. Unset is
# still right for local single-host development, where it means "this host".
